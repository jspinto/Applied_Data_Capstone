<b>2 - Madrid - Museum educators service (project):</b>
<br><br>
The idea is to begin a public service with about 20 museum educators in the city of Madrid (Spain).
<br><br>
These educators are not part of the staff of any museum and they should be able to go to the assigned museums to perform different activities.
<br><br>
We will start with a main base located in the Retiro Park (lat: 40.415, long: -3.684) where we will set up our principal information point. We also will set up three auxiliary offices in three specific museums with a particular number of educators in each one of them.
<br><br>
It is not about having a specific educator in each museum, but about being able to establish three small offices from which to go to each other museum when necessary.
<br><br>
For this project we are going to locate the main museums within a radius of 2 km around our main base with the help of the Foursquare API and the visitors statistics of each museum. We also are going to search the best particular museum to place each auxiliar offiice and to propose how many educators we can allocate in each one.
